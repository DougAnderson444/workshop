### 17: Player movement updates

[kappa-view-kv](https://github.com/noffle/kappa-view-kv) has an event listener API called `onUpdate`, which emits the key that was modified, as well as its new value:

```js
core.api.kv.onUpdate(function (key, msg) {
    console.log(key, '=', msg.value)
})
```

#### Exercise

See if you can listen for key updates and have messages of type `player-position` update a player character on the screen with neat-log.

#### Tips

- You can draw a single character to neat-log in your draw method using `txt-blit`:

```js
function draw (state) {
    var screen = []
    
    var playerIcon = ['@']
    for (var i = 0; i < state.playerPositions.length; i++) {
        var pos = state.playerPositions[i]
        blit(screen, playerIcon, pos.x, pos.y)
    }
    
    return screen.join('\n')
}
```

#### And beyond!

From here you should be able to hook this up with your `discovery-swarm` code and see other players, move around, and chat in real-time! You can even play the game while you're offline and your movements & messages will sync to others when they see you again.

There are tons of fun additions you could make to the game from here:

- show a text bubble over each player with their latest message, instead of a chat window
- provide a keyboard key that lets each player cycle the colour of their character ([chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) is handy for this)
- port the UI to the browser! you can replace `discovery-swarm` with [webrtc-swarm](https://github.com/mafintosh/webrtc-swarm) to find other peers using WebRTC. You could have terminal players able to interact with browser players!
- add items that players can pick up and drop, and manage their inventory
- generate [random levels](https://github.com/domasx2/dungeon-generator) using a shared random seed, that players can explore together
