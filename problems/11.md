### 11: Query most recent messages

`kappa-view-list` has a function called `tail(limit, fn)` that will watch the last `limit` messages of the sorted list and run `fn` as `fn(msgs)` whenever that window changes, supplying the new last `limit` messages.

#### Exercise

Copy your old code back over that lets you read `process.stdin` for lines of text & writes them to the feed.

Then, modify your code to listen for chat view changes and re-write the last 10 chat messages to the terminal.

Once you solve this exercise continue to [exercise 12](12.html)

#### Tips

- Remember that `tail` will fire its callback *every time* the bottom of the list updates, including initial indexing when the program starts!
- You can use `core.ready(function () { ... })` to run code *after* the views have caught up with what's already in the database.
