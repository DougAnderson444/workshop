### 16: Player movement keys

`neat-log` can capture keyboard input. If you named your instance of neat-log `app`, you'd write

```js
app.input.on('left', function () {})
```

#### Exercise

Make the left/right/up/down arrow keys publish messages that update your player's x/y coordinates.

See if you can figure out how to use the [kappa-view-kv](https://github.com/noffle/kappa-view-kv)'s `get` API to fetch a player's latest x/y position.

Once you solve this exercise continue to [exercise 17](17.md)
