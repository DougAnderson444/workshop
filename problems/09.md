### 9: Reading feed data from multifeed

Now that we have created a multifeed, each `hypercore`  represents a different user in the application. When we replicate with another multifeed peer, we download their feeds and upload ours.

`multifeed.feeds()` returns a list of feeds, which are just hypercore objects (ie. they each have a `createReadStream()` function)..

```js
multi.ready(function () {
  var feeds = multi.feeds()
  feeds.forEach(function (feed) {
    // feed is a hypercore! (remember reading from hypercores in previous exercises?)
  })
})
```

#### Exercise

Using `console.log`, write all chat messages to the screen from every hypercore in the multifeed. Have it iterate over all chat messages from all hypercores.

#### Tips
- `feed.createReadStream(options)` has an option called `{live: true}`. If you set this, the stream will stay open and keep emitting new data as it is appended to the hypercore.
- You can always create more feeds locally by calling `multi.writer(function (err, feed) {})`.
