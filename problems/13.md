### 13: Dynamic chat window

Now you should have an empty box drawing in `ui.js` *and* a hypercore that you can read chat messages from. Let's combine them!

#### Exercise

See if you can get the chat window to fill itself with the last 9 messages from the hypercore.

#### Tips

- `createReadStream` takes a `start` and `end` parameter, and each hypercore has a `length` property.
- you can asynchronously populate `state` in the `mainloop` function.

Once you solve this exercise continue to [exercise 14](14.html)
